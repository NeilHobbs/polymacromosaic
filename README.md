# polymacromosaic

Implements a landscape (macro) mosaic for evaluation of spatial evaluation of insecticide resistance management strategies in a quantative genetics framework.

WARNING:This model is active developement. 


## Description

polymacromosaic aims to extend the modelling framework presented in the polyres package. polymacromosaic allows for the spatial deployment of insecticides. This is achieved by generating a tile based landscape, where times can be designated as either intervention sites or refugia. 


## Defining Deployment Strategy

## Running Simulations

## Getting Data From Simulations

## Visualising Simulations
Data can be plotted either as the tiled landscape ```plot_macromosaic_tiles``` or as a time series ```plot_simulation_time_series```.
